# Invoice generator
>An invoice generator that generates a txt file invoice based on input

## About The Project
Thisr is a Python CLI program in which users are able to generate itemized invoices instantly. It accepts customer details, item names, prices, and quantities and automatically calculates subtotals, 6% SST, and totals. The invoice generated is saved in a human-readable .txt file format. The project highlights my understanding of file handling, input validation, arithmetic calculations, and real-world logical design in Python.
